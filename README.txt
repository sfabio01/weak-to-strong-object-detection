datasets/<Dataset>-reduced
Datasets used to train the weak model. 
Removed about 40% of the images from the original training set.

datasets/<Dataset>-<model>-weak-labels.zip
Labels of the original training set generated by the weak model.

results/<model>-weak-<Dataset>
Performance metrics of the trained weak model

results/<model>-student-<model>-<Dataset>
Performance metrics of the strong student model

results/<model>-ceiling-<Dataset>
Performance metrics of the strong ceiling model

WEAK MODEL
Smaller model trained on the reduced dataset.
Will use this to generate the labels to train the strong student model.

STUDENT MODEL
Larger model trained on the generated (weak) labels.

CEILING MODEL
Larger model trained on the ground-truth labels for comparison.
